## Summary

Many people go to IT because of high salaries,  many because of new discoveries. I just want to do what I love and get a good salary. I don’t plan to create a robot that will play football better than Ronaldo or go through walls. I would like to work as an ordinary programmer, maybe something more.

## Skills 

I  studied programming languages such as  (learning  at university C++),  HTML, CSS.
